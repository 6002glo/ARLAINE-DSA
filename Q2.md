# Arrays vs. Linked Lists

This document outlines the key differences between arrays and linked lists.

## Differences

### Memory Allocation

* **Arrays:** Employ fixed, contiguous memory allocation. [cite: 1]
* **Linked Lists:** Employ dynamic, dispersed memory allocation. [cite: 1]

### Performance

* **Arrays:** Provide fast access to elements (O(1)). [cite: 2]
* **Linked Lists:** Provide slow access to elements (O(n)) due to sequential traversal. [cite: 2]

### Insertion & Deletion

* **Arrays:** Insertion and deletion operations are slow (O(n)) because they require shifting elements. [cite: 3]
* **Linked Lists:** Insertion and deletion operations are quick (O(1)) when the node pointer is provided. [cite: 3]
